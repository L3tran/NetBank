# How to run
from the folder where you want to clone the repo, run the command
`git clone <repo-url>`

then from the app's root folder (where the pom.xml is kept)
`mvn clean install`

then
`mvn spring-boot:run`

you should see it output a successful startup message.
to test, navigate in your browser to `localhost:8080`
you should see the basic react app page
